## Background

A `did:key` method driver for the [`did-io`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/did-io)
client library.

The did:key method is used to express public keys in a way that doesn't require 
a DID Registry of any kind. Its general format is:

```
did:key:<multibase encoded, multicodec identified, public key>
```

So, for example, the following DID would be derived from a base-58 encoded 
ed25519 public key:

```
did:key:z279zvWFCpJdqTuZtJRtyYMC1nJy5eb1rLfAMiv5FfPBiy3S
```
